# Webcam_EyeTracker_Matlab_Arduino
This is a tutorial for making a cheap Eytracker with a webcam, arduino and matlab 

The youtube tutorial can be found at this link



Before running the matlab code connect arduino to the computer and run the "Arduino_Matlab_serial.ino" file. This will allow you to make 
arduino communicate with matlab. 

(Further info about arduino matlab communication without downloading any matlab-arduino toolbox
can be found at this link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr21ypVgb1M&t=13s)

IMPORTANT NOTE: this is not a professional eyetracker, i just used it to monitor the position of the eye during an experiment.
If you need to track a saccade, measure the number of fixations or a reaction time, i suggest you to buy a professional eyetracker.
